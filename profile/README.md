**XR Robotics** is an open-source initiative for developers and professionals in **XR**, **robotics**, and **AI**. We provide XRoboToolkit, a suite of cross-device SDKs, frameworks, and sample applications that enable **real-time remote robot operation** through XR devices.

Follow these steps to build and run a full XR-to-robot teleoperation sample on a **PICO 4 Ultra headset and a Linux x86 PC**. This sample has been tested only under the below system OS requirements:
Linux x86 PC: Ubuntu 22.04
PICO 4 Ultra: User OS >5.12. Special permission with enterprise version and VST camera permission is required for headset camera access.
1. **Install XRoboToolkit-PC-Service**  
   - Download [deb package for ubuntu 22.04](https://github.com/XR-Robotics/XRoboToolkit-PC-Service/releases/download/v1.0.0/XRoboToolkit_PC_Service_1.0.0_ubuntu_22.04_amd64.deb), or build from the [repo source](https://github.com/XR-Robotics/XRoboToolkit-PC-Service).
   - To install, use command
     ```bash
      sudo dpkg -i XRoboToolkit-PC-Service_1.0.0_ubuntu_22.04_amd64.deb
      ```
2. **Clone & Set Up Python Teleop Sample**  
   - [XRoboToolkit-Teleop-Sample-Python](https://github.com/XR-Robotics/XRoboToolkit-Teleop-Sample-Python)
3. **Install the XR App on Headset**
   - Turn on developer mode on Pico 4 Ultra headset first ([Enable developer mode on Pico 4 Ultra](https://developer.picoxr.com/ja/document/unreal/test-and-build/)), and make sure that [adb](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) is installed properly.
   - Download [XRoboToolkit-PICO.apk](https://github.com/XR-Robotics/XRoboToolkit-Unity-Client/releases/download/v1.0.0/XRoboToolkit-PICO.apk) on a PC with adb installed.
   - To install apk on the headset, use command
     ```bash
      adb shell install XRoboToolkit-PICO.apk
      ```
4. **Run Sample in Simulated Environment or on Real Robot**
   - Connect robot PC and Pico 4 Ultra under the same network
   - On robot PC, double click app icon of `XRoboToolkit-PC-Service` or run service `/opt/apps/roboticsservice/runService.sh`
   - Open app `XRoboToolkit` on the Pico headset. Details of the Unity app can be found in the [Unity source repo](https://github.com/XR-Robotics/XRoboToolkit-Unity-Client).
   - Follow instructions on [XRoboToolkit-Teleop-Sample-Python](https://github.com/XR-Robotics/XRoboToolkit-Teleop-Sample-Python) to run test in simulated environment or on real robot.
