## 🚀 Get Started

Follow these steps to build and run a full XR-to-robot teleoperation demo on **PICO 4 Ultra** and a **UR5 robot**.

1. **Install XRoboToolkit-PC-Service**  
   - (Windows: `...`, Linux: `...`)  
   - Or build from the repo source.

2. **Clone & Set Up Python Teleop Sample**  
   - [XRoboToolkit-Teleop-Sample-Python](https://github.com/XR-Robotics/XRoboToolkit-Teleop-Sample-Python)

3. **Install the XR App on Headset**  
   - Download and install [XRoboToolkit-PICO.apk](https://github.com/XR-Robotics/XRoboToolkit-Unity-Client/releases/download/v1.0.0/XRoboToolkit-PICO.apk) on supported XR devices.

4. **Test in Real or Simulated Environment**  
   - Supports PICO 4 Ultra + UR5 (real or Gazebo/Isaac Sim simulations)
